# The Source

Welcome, traveler, to The Source. The worlds here are perilous and full of
danger, but also full of promise and adventure! In The Source, we prioritize a
few ground rules in order to ensure that everyone has as much fun as possible as
well as the best adventure they can.

This document will also contain erratta that have come up during
[6E](https://s-jared.itch.io/6e) games so things can be somewhat consistent in
the future.

## Ground Rules

These are the basic ground rules that should be followed at all times.

### Be Creative

Just because it looks like something doesn't mean you have to treat it like it
is that thing. Don't be afraid to bend the rules or go off the beaten path. The
real fun happens there. You may have to make the Dungeon Master improvise a
situation, this is never a bad thing.

### Make sure everyone is involved

Resist the temptation to railroad the adventure in a non-inclusive way for too
long. It can feel like fun to do it, but your party-mates are your friends and
should be involved as much as possible. That's how the stories of heroes become
legends of groups.

### Make sure everyone is comfortable

Don't be afraid to let the Dungeon Master know if something is overwhelming or
the like. They will be happy to help refocus people away from uncomfortable
topics to ensure everyone has the most fun they can. Let the Dungeon Master know
in a private message or with the Roll20 macro #uncomfortable.

### Be Respectful

Everyone comes from a different background and has had different life
experiences. These experiences shape their lives and can sometimes manifest in
the course of play. Respect this, this diversity of experience helps shape
people's adventures and can lead to glory.

### Maximize Fun

We're ultimately here to play a game together. Take advantage of this and help
to maximize the amount of fun everyone has. This will help games to be more
memorable and lead to a stronger friendship.

The rules are very light on purpose, but even then they are paper thin when it
comes to maximizing enjoyment. The Dungeon Master will usually be the judge of
when to break the rules unless you can convince them otherwise.

### Don't Be An Asshole

Nobody likes it when someone is an asshole.

with imagemagick). If you are in doubt as to what can fly, ask the Dungeon
Master and they'll work something out with you. A blank character sheet can be
found [here](https://xena.greedo.xeserv.us/6E/Blank.pdf).
