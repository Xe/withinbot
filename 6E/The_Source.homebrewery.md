# Basics

Welcome, traveler, to The Source. The worlds here are perilous and full of danger, but also full of promise and adventure! In The Source, we prioritize a few ground rules in order to ensure that everyone has as much fun as possible as well as the best adventure they can.

This document will also contain erratta that have come up during games so things can be somewhat consistent in the future.

## Ground Rules

These are the basic ground rules that should be followed at all times.

### Be Creative

Just because it looks like something doesn't mean you have to treat it like it is that thing. Don't be afraid to bend the rules or go off the beaten path. The real fun happens there. You may have to make the Dungeon Master improvise a situation, this is never a bad thing.

### Make Sure Everyone is Involved

Resist the temptation to railroad the adventure in a non-inclusive way for too long. It can feel like fun to do it, but your party-mates are your friends and should be involved as much as possible. That's how the stories of heroes become legends of groups.

### Make Sure Everyone is Comfortable

Don't be afraid to let the Dungeon Master know if something is overwhelming or the like. They will be happy to help refocus people away from uncomfortable topics to ensure everyone has the most fun they can. Let the Dungeon Master know in a private message or with the Roll20 macro #uncomfortable.

### Be Respectful

Everyone comes from a different background and has had different life experiences. These experiences shape their lives and can sometimes manifest in the course of play. Respect this, this diversity of experience helps shape people's adventures and can lead to glory.

### Maximize Fun

We're ultimately here to play a game together. Take advantage of this and help to maximize the amount of fun everyone has. This will help games to be more memorable and lead to a stronger friendship.

___
The rules are very light on purpose, but even then they are paper thin when it comes to maximizing enjoyment. The Dungeon Master will usually be the judge of when to break the rules unless you can convince them otherwise.

### Don't Be An Asshole

Nobody likes it when someone is an asshole.

## Dice Notation

The Source is a dice-heavy game. As such this rulebook will use notation to represent dice rolls. At a high level, it looks like this:

___
[number of dice]d[number of dice sides][+/-modifier]

___
This notation is used to help make descriptions of dice actions a lot more compact. For example, instead of saying something like:

> As the Artificier, roll a standard six-sided dice for your basic attack damage.

Instead this notation lets that information be encoded as:

> As the artificier, your basic attack does d6 damage.

This notation is also understood by the Discord bot associated with The Source, Within. This bot will be explained in more detail below.

___
Sometimes descriptions of things will include the dice notation spelled out longhand with the dice notation in parentheses. This will be used to help the document flow and read more casually.

## Guide to Reading

This document is full of ideas. These ideas should be used to help guide your explorations and aventures. If ideas in here don't sound like they would work for you, scrape them out and discard them.

<div class='footnote'>BASIC RULES</div>

# Basic Rules

At a high level, all of the action in 6E games boils down to two things: The Basic Move and storytelling. Everything else builds on top of these two fundamentals to create the story of your players and their actions.

## The Basic Move

When you do something risky or dangerous, roll 2d6 and add a relevant attribute score.

- On a 12+, you do it perfectly, with some additional benefit.
- On a 10-11, you do it perfectly.
- On a 7-9, you do it, but with some cost or complication.
- On a 6-, you fail to do it, with some additional negative consequence.

Every player has the following attributes:

| Stat Name | Acronym | Example |
|:----------|:--------|:--------|
| Strength | STR | Damage, breaking things |
| Dexteriry | DEX | Aim, finesse, acrobatics |
| Constitution | CON | Endurance |
| Intelligence | INT | Reasoning, knowledge about the area |
| Wisdom | WIS | Percieving traps, calming monsters |
| Charisma | CHA | Social skills, bluffing, haggling |

Every class will also have their own special moves. These will build on top of the basic move (EG: Clerics/Wizards casting spells, Artificers creating things) and may cause disadvantageous side effects if they fail.

Moves only make sense when there is a sense of _risk_ involved to things. Breaking a door down isn't risky unless there are monsters behind it. Picking a lock isn't risky if nobody can hear it or catch you doing it. Haggling isn't risky unless you are starved for gold. Attacks aren't risky if they aren't fantastic.

## Dungeon Master Advice

This is a fantasy roleplaying game. Your job is to help the players explore the world, have adventures and craft legends as a group. Read through this supplement and maybe a Dungeons and Dragons starter guide or two. Take things as they happen and don't be afraid to ask your players for ideas. Improvisation only can go so far.

Also, failure doesn't have to be a *complete failure*. If you fail a hit on a monster, you could just transfer that damage to another nearby monster instead of nullifying it out. Doing this helps keep the players in the flow of the game and make everything fun for everyone.

Remember the rules (even though there are only a few of them) are NOT written in stone; and if something comes up that you feel is "wrong", make up something else! Don't be afraid to ask your players for amusing ideas. They are a very valuable resource for this!

As the Dungeon Master, you  should let the players know what the risks are before they roll. This lets players be informed and they might change their minds about their actions. This is good, this means your players are thinking!

To quote the 6E handbook:

> **When you fight an enemy in melee**, roll+STR. A 7-9 might mean that you successfully do your damage to the enemy, but they do their damage to you, or disarm you. A 6- might mean that you don’t do your damage to the enemy, and they do their damage
> 
> **When shooting an enemy at range**, roll+DEX. A 7-9 might mean that you successfully do your damage to the enemy, but they manage to move into melee range of you and swing - What do you do? A 6- might mean that you miss, and that was your last arrow!
> 
> **When you look for rumors in town**, buy a round for the local publicans and roll+CHA. A 10+ might mean you get two rumors. A 7-9 might mean you only get 1 rumor. A 6- might mean you put your trust in bad information.

## Using Withinbot

[Withinbot](https://github.com/Xe/withinbot) is a Discord bot written in Rust that helps to manage dice and stat rolling for 6E games. It is present by default in the guild for The Source, but if you want to add it to your own guild you can click [this link][withinbotinvite].

##### Dice

Dice rolling is done with the ~roll command. It takes arguments that look like this:
___
~roll [number of dice]d[number of dice sides][+/-modifier]  
~roll 3d6  
[2, 5, 2] = 9

The bot will reply with the list of dice that fed into the roll and the result.

##### Stats

Stats can be rolled with the ~roll_stats command. It takes no arguments and creates a stat sheet for a new 6E character.

___
~roll_stats  
Your stats are: STR: 1, DEX: -2, CON: -1, INT: 0, WIS: 1, CHA: 2: HP: 5

##### Bug Reports

Report any bugs or issues with Withinbot [here](https://github.com/Xe/withinbot/new).

<div class='footnote'>BASIC RULES</div>

## Character Creation

Character creation is done in a few phases:

1. Help everyone choose a class and have them choose a class advancement for level one
2. Tell them how to roll their attributes
3. Tell them how to roll their hitpoints
4. Help them figure out how many inventory slots they have and explain how weight works
5. Get some equipment

### Choosing A Class

Show the players the list of classes in the book. If they want to run something else, give them the blank sheet and help them work through creating their own class. Make sure everyone has the base character sheet for their character. If running a game with people who haven't played tabletop games before, stick to the 4 core classes of Cleric, Fighter, Thief and Wizard.

Have them fill out their name and pick an advancement on the second page of their character sheet. Encourage them to pick an advanacement that sounds amusing to them, or something that could become useful. Players will get another advancement every level they gain.

### Rolling for Attributes

Attributes in 6E are a bit different than they are in other tabletop games. For each attribute roll two six-sided dice (2d6). Then use the following table to determine your attribute:

| Roll | Attribute |
|------|-----------|
| 11+ | 2 |
| 9-10 | 1 |
| 6-8 | 0 |
| 4-5 | -1 |
| 3- | -2 |

Put these atttributes in the circles labled Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitituion (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS) and Charisma (CHA). These function as bonuses to rolls for the basic move.

### Rolling for Hitpoints

Add up your level (in most cases this will be one) with your constitution stat. If this number ends up being below one, it's one. Roll that many six-sided dice and pick as many as your character has levels. This becomes your hitpoint (HP) stat. Consider this example:

Faeor is at level 1 with a constitution stat of 2. Faeor rolls three six-sided dice and gets a 5, 4 and a 6. Faeor then chooses which dice to keep as their HP stat, picking the 6.

Players may re-roll their HP if they are stuck with only one hitpoint. If a player consistently gets one for their HP roll, the Dungeon Master should give them a HP stat that they feel makes sense for the player.

### Inventory Slots

By default, every player gets 12 inventory slots. This number is then modified by their strength statistic. If the player's strength is +2, then they get two more inventory slots for a total of 14. If their strength is -2, then they lose two inventory slots for a total of 10. Cross off the numbers for any unusable inventory slots.

If a player ever carries more stuff then they have inventory slots, they get 2 subtracted from all of their rolls.

### Getting Equipment

Everyone starts out with one or two remarkable items, or items that give players a small advantage in extremely specific circumstances. There are some examples below. Don't worry about basic adventuring gear like weapons, armor and torches. They can be gotten with gear points.

- Dueling Sword - +1 when you’re defending your honor with threats of (or actual) violence.
- Quick Pick - +1 when you need to open a lock quick or quiet, so no one notices.
- Lucky Helmet - +1 when you need to avoid a freak accident.
- Trusty Waterskin - You (only) may drink from it when you rest to roll one additional die for your HP — keep the normal amount though.
- Component Pouch - If you would forget a spell, you may spend the contents to prevent forgetting it. One use, refills when you refresh your Gear bubbles.
- Fancy Hat - +1 when you’re making a deal with a merchant or statesman.
- Mercurial Wand - Once/day you can use this to cast a random spell from the Wizard Spell List — better roll for it!
- Loaded Dice - +1 when you gamble with them.

### Gear Points

Gear points can be spent to acquire "basic" adventuring gear like torches, light weapons, staffs, bows, shields, armor and miscellaneous things. When you need a standard piece of mundane adventuring gear that’s not currently in your inventory, you may fill in an empty bubble to declare that you had the item all along. If you do so, write the item in your inventory.

When you’re in town, you may spend 25g to empty all of your gear points. You get to keep the items if you want.

### Making Things Up

If players want to have more spells or things they can do, help them work out something new. You can use descriptions from other fantasy games like Dungeons and Dragons or Dungeon World. Just read the names and descriptions, the stats aren't as important (the exact stats in those games are likely to be balanced for that game and that may disrupt the balance in 6E).

---
Don't be afraid to make things up though, that's how things become fun!

<div class='footnote'>RACES</div>

# Races

The world of The Source is home to a wide array of races. Each of these can have members be good, evil or somewhere inbetween. Each race has their own set of bonuses that may or may not be useful. They each have their own ancestral languages, but every player character race can at least speak one language in common with all of the others called Common. The details of how Common works are not explained here; but just trust me, it works. Unless specified otherwise, all races have no particular advantage or disadvantage in anything. Each race will have a +1 bonus to charisma when in a town assocaited with their species. 

## Cetaceans

The Cetaceans are the alpha predators of the sea, their hegemony controls most of the ocean Tel. The denizens of the waters know of and fear the Cetaceans. The Cetaceans are a powerful species. They usually have a fantastic knowledge of Common as well as their native language L'ewa. They will also have a -1 charisma vice while in towns associated with Sharks.

### Racial Bonuses

Cetaceans can use their tails as weapons for basic attacks. Cetaceans can also stay underwater for up to two hours at a time without having to come back up to breathe. Cetaceans also have a +1 charisma bonus when dealing with aquatic creatures. Cetaceans suffer in deserts, requiring a lot of drinking water. 

### Character Profile: Divae

Divae is a Wizard Cetacean that broke free of the Royal Academy of Magic after a disagreement on how to handle side contracts with bounty hunters. She wears a witchy outfit and holds a wand made out of the bones of the first beast she slew as a child with a bead of glass on the top.

Divae comes from the middle class of Cetacean society. She had an advantage out of the gate, but her family was devastated by the sudden loss of her father duing the Shark Rebellion. Her magical aura is a bright purple-pink.

___
TODO(Xe): Art of Divae

## Dragons

Dragons are fire-breathing, magic-wielding tanks. They hail from the mountains of The Source. They are respected by many but can be feared by Humans. Their native language is a dragon language derived from Dohvazul, but they are fluent in Common for trade.

### Racial Bonuses

Dragons do not need a weapon to do basic attacks. Their claws, tail and teeth function as usable weapons.

Dragons can also learn a Breathe Fire ability for one of their advancements. This will always work outside of battle for little things, but can deal d4 damage with a 25% chance of burning inside battle. Rolls for fire breathing are rolls for constitution, as it takes endurance to maintain fire breath for a long amount of time.

### Character Profile: Gassas

Gassas is a Monk Dragon from the peaks of Sewlet in the northeast of The Source. They trained for years to learn the basics behind Ki arts. They have written the book on how to successfully weaponize the Ki arts as well as using their peaceful properties for other advantages.

Gassas comes from a low-class family of Dragons. They are not the richest Dragon around, but they are also not the poorest Dragon around. They are also nonbinary, and this has caused some tension with their family. Joining the monks has helped to separate them from their family, which has helped their relationship to heal.

## Elves

Everyone's favorite pointy-eared magic users are back. Elves hail from the forests of The Source. Some of the most powerful druids and shapeshifters of the land are Elves. Their native language is derived from Sindarin, but they are also taught Common as part of their education.

Elves are excellent allies, foragers and friends. Having an elf in your party can help make adventuring a lot safer.

### Racial Bonuses

Elves require a weapon to do basic attacks, but gain +1 dexterity in forests or green areas. Elves can also harvest non-foraged materials when harvesting materials when they learn the Pure Foraging advancement. Elves that know spells can also perform very weak variants of them without needing a roll, this could be useful for starting campfires or similar small feats.

### Character Profile: Vesryn

Vesryn is an Elf Cleric that hails from the forests of Kahsis in The Source. She has been learning the ins and outs of her peaceful kind of existence for years, and one day decided she wanted to seek out adventure. She is fluent in Common, but not enough that she feels confident trading alone.

Vesryn comes from the middle class of Elf society. She became disillusioned with the other elves after a lot of the information she thought she knew about the other races turned out to be false. She now works to help unlearn her past and relearn what others are actually like.

___
TODO(Xe): Art of Vesryn

## Kobolds

Kobolds are a vaguely humanoid species that look somewhat like short dragons. They are masters of building traps and preparing ambushes. Their native language is unpronouncable in human tongues, but they are able to speak Common. Kobolds have experience living in dark underground areas, giving them a natural aptitude for them.

### Racial Bonuses

Kobolds that take the Night Vision advancement do not need a torch or lantern to see in the dark. This effect cannot normally be transferred to other units (unless the Dungeon Master would find the result of doing so amusing).

They also may have some difficulty with merchants due to fairytales about Kobolds stealing their items and gold.

Kobolds can perform basic attacks with their claws or teeth.

### Character Profile: Dukbe

Dukbe is a Shapeshifter Kobold that grew up in the mines of Anpar, south of the Sewlet mountain in The Source. They have been studying their craft for years, becoming an expert in impersonating others and learning their languages. Dukbe is fluent in most of the languages in The Source, their shapeshifting ability let them take classes without fear of discrimination.

Dukbe is genderfluid, which gives them a natural charisma bonus because they are able to blend in so well. Dukbe doesn't come from any particular class of Kobold society. They joined the party in Usill while Vesryn and Divae were looking for a way to explore the Cave of Souls.

<div class='footnote'>RACES</div>

## Nopons

Nopons are a relatively new addition to The Source. They initially arrived in a colony airship after the devastation of their previous home. They are a short yet surprisingly industrious people. Some of the best Artificiers and Tinkers in the land are or studied under the elder Nopon masters. Nopons have learned to speak Common, but have a notable accent that other races find cute.

### Racial Bonuses

Nopons seem completely nonthreatening to traders. They get a +1 charisma bonus when haggling for prices because their accent seems disarming and cute.

Nopons are also very short, which means that attacks need to be rethought for them. Their ears can be used to hold things, which means they can carry three items at once. They do need a weapon to perform basic attacks though.

### Character Profile: Aruna

Aruna is a Grafter Nopon that was part of the initial colonization of The Source. He used to assist a research division of the Cetacean Hedgemony, but broke with them after seeing how Leana was mistreated. He spent 20 years with the research division, learning everything he could about how monsters work and how they could be used as a source of inspiration.

Nopon society lacks the concept of social classes, but after they were absorbed into the Hedgemony, Aruna ended up in the higher tiers of it due to his innate skills with grafting monsters together like building bricks. Aruna works to right the wrongs that he has faced in life, and uses his position in the party to help make life better for all involved.

TODO(Xe): Art of Aruna

## Sharks

After decades of oppression by the Cetacean hegemony, the Sharks have finally set up their own kingdom with their own laws and relations with the other kingdoms in the land of The Source. Sharks speak Common and have an understanding of the Cetacean language L'ewa.

### Racial Bonuses

Sharks do not require any weapons for basic attacks, They can either savagely bite their opponents or clobber them with their tail. Sharks also can stay underwater indefinitely as long as they keep moving. Sharks also suffer in deserts, requiring a lot of drinking water.

Sharks can learn a Tail Stun advancement that allows them to stun enemies for 1d4 turns if they win a dexterity roll.

### Character Profile: Leana

Leana is an Artificier Thresher Shark that used to work for the Royal Society of Engineering for the Cetacean Hegemony. She had become used to wearing the uniform of the society she spent 15 years in service to, but her pants are the pants of the people. Leana is not afraid in battle because she can use her tail to stun opponents and flee.

Leana comes from commoners. She worked up to being a respected engineer from nothing, even though she was oppressed in the Cetacean society due to her race. Despite everything, she keeps an upbeat and positive attitude. She wears custom-made magical gauntlets that function as her forge engine, allowing her to engineer things together into genius creations.

# Classes

These are all of the character classes described in the rulebook for The Source. Each class has its own advantages and disadvantages, and is balanced enough to make things somewhat fair, but not enough that the player is drowned by rules. Each of the classes described in this book will have their own page or two in this document. They will describe the advantages and disadvantages of the class.

These aren't the limits to what classes can exist in gameplay (in fact they were really just what I could find easily on itch.io and split into separate PDFs with imagemagick). If you are in doubt as to what can fly, ask the Dungeon Master and they'll work something out with you. A blank character sheet can be found attached to the end of this document. 

## Extra Classes

## Creating Your Own Class

Don't like any of these classes? You can work with your Dungeon Master to create your own class. For inspiration on this you can use any set of details as a base to work off of. The zine [Advanced Jared Sinclair's 6th Edition—Player's Option: Skills & Powers](https://erinking.itch.io/advanced-jared-sinclairs-6th-edition-players-option-skills-powers) can help with this. Alternatively, crack open a Dungeons and Dragons or Dungeon World manual and look through the list of classes that have been created. You could be anything from a Druid to [a butter-passing robot](https://codyfaulk.itch.io/butter-passing-robot). The sky's the limit!

## Come Up with a Backstory

If it helps you get into character, come up with a few sentences that describe your character's background, their life story, how they came to join this adventuring party. Who did they know beforehand? What was that relationship like? How did that relationship influence others in the party?

If this sounds like too much effort, feel free to cut this part out and cast it aside.

<div class='footnote'>CLASS NOTES</div>

## The Artificier

The Artificier is a class defined by their ability to fashion genius creations out of other things. These genius creations are highly breakable (depending on the materials) and there is a limit to how many times the forge engine can be used in a limited amount of time. 

### Basic Rules

At character creation, count the number of empty inventory slots you have and roll that many four-sided dice. Multiply the result by five. This gets you your starting gold.

As an Artificier, you can spend an hour to create a mundane non-consumable object.

After your fourth and eighth advancements, gold to create genius creations increases by 10.

When you're in town, you can spend 25gp to auction off your active genius creations, clearing out your creation bubbles.

Your basic attacks do d6 damage.

### Forge Engine

The Artificier carries a handheld forge engine with them (it does not take up an inventory slot) that can be used to make various genius creations. This forge engine takes gold and materials, then creates something using it. The materials fed into the forge engine influence the effect of the creations. The following table will help the Dungeon Master balance the creations:

| Material      | Strength |
|:--------------|:---------|
| Foraged Wood  | 2        |
| Wood          | 3        |
| Foraged Metal | 4        |
| Metal         | 5        |

The Strength of a given material influences how many failed (or partially failed) rolls the creation can survive before it will break (this should be taken as a soft guideline for the Dungeon Master, not a hard one). Genius creations will also only be active for twice as many turns as the strength shows. The more gold something costs, the more materials it will require (the Dungeon Master can help decide if there are enough materials to craft something).

Crafting with the forge engine requires intelligence, so rolls for crafting things are rolls for intelligence. When you attempt to create a genius creation, spend the stated gold and roll for intelligence. On a 7-9, choose one of the following effects. On a 6-, choose neither:

- Your creation is successful
- There isn't an energy discharge that stalls the device for one turn

The Artificier can also pre-create genius creations in a tavern or other safe space and store them in their inventory, provided they have room and materials for them.

### Genius Creations

This list is not complete and will be added to as facts and circumstances emerge.

___
1. **Alchemical Elixir**, 10 gp, 1 weight. With an empty flask in your possession, you create one of the following elixirs:
   - Healing. Heal 2d4+INT HP 
   - Resilient. Gain +1 Armor 
   - Brave. +1d4 to attack rolls for a short time 
   - Flight. Drinker gains flight for a short time 
1. **Arcane Ballista Cannon**, 25 gp, 3 weight. You create a small magical bipedal cannon. It shares your initiative count, but acts after you do. It has +2 Armor and HP equal to four times your level. It attacks for 1d6 damage. This uses a creation bubble when deployed.
1. **Arcane Protector Cannon**, 4 weight, 30 gp. You create a small magical bipedal cannon that emits a burst of positive energy which heals 1d6 nearby allies for 1d6+INT.

## The Cleric

The Cleric is a holy warrior bound to protect and execute justice with their religious spite as the fuel for their adventures. They can cast spells and gain new ones when they spend an hour in silent communion with their deity. Spells are gifts however, they can be forgotten as easily as they can be remembered.

### Basic Rules

At character creation, pick a spell alongside picking an advancement. This spell will be available both inside and outside of battle. If one of the spells on the list doesn't tickle your fancy, work with your Dungeon Master to come up with a new one.

When you're in town, you may spend 25gp to empty out all of your equipment bubbles.

Your basic attacks do d6 damage.

When you spend an hour or so in silent communion with your deity, you forget all the spells you have memorized and may memorize your level + WIS number of spells. You may choose any spell on the Cleric list. You can do this in battle in exchange for not being able to act for 2 turns. If you get attacked during your communion, you will not be able to learn any spells.

### Casting Spells

To cast a spell, use your wisdom stat as the bonus for your basic move. On a 7-9 roll, choose one of the following effects. On a 6- roll, choose neither.

- The spell affects its intended target
- You don't forget the spell

If you forget the spell, you should cross it off your list of available spells. You can relearn it when you are next in communion.

### Spells

This list will be added to as facts and circumstances emerge.

- **Command** - A creature obeys a single, three-word command that does not directly harm it.
- **Control Weather** - You may alter the type of weather at will, but you do not otherwise control it. It lasts 12 hours.
- **Cure Disease** - Cure all status effects from someone.
- **Hold Person** - A nearby person or humanoid creature is unable to move for d4 turns.
- **Inspire** - In battle, nearby (within an aura of 3 map squares) allies may treat their roll as if it is one tier better.
- **Remove Curse** - Remove all curses from something you touch.
- **Scry** - See through the eyes of a creature you touched earlier today.
- **Silence** - Negate all sound within 15 feet of the casting site.
- **True Sight** - See through nearby illusions.
- **Ward** - A silver 40 foot circle appears on the ground, centered at the caster. Choose one thing that cannot cross it: living creatures, dead creatures, projectiles or metal.

### Advancements

- **Resolute** - Gain +1 Wisdom.
- **Indomitable** - Gain +1 Strength.
- **Genial** - Gain +1 Charisma.
- **Worldly** - Take an advancement from another class.
- **Studious** - Add a random Wizard spell to your deity's spell list.
- **Studious** - Add a random Wizard spell to your deity's spell list.
- **Turn Undead** - When you renounce the unholy products of necromancy, roll for wisdom. On 10+, all mindless undead flee from your presence and all intelligent undead are momentarily stunned for d4+2 turns. On a 7-9, half of them are.
- **Cure Light Wounds** - When you touch a wounded person, you may heal them from d6 hitpoints plus your level. You may do this as many times as you have levels.
- **Divine Armor** - When you have no armor, you have 2 armor.
- **Death Rites** - After a battle, when you take time to dedicate your victory to your deity of choice and deal with the dead, you and anyone who helps may add one to their next roll.

## Fighter

The Fighter is a pure warror type. The tools of their trade are their weapons, fists and other appendages. They do not have spells, magic or other kinds of feats, but they make up for that with their sheer potential for inflicting damage on anyone who threatens them or their party. They can also learn the fighting styles of worthy opponents.

### Basic Rules

Your basic attacks do d8 damage, and do not require a weapon (no matter what racial information says).

# Encounters and You

Monster encounters are more about the story than the actual numbers of the fight. Keep this in mind when creating responses to moves. Here are some important guidelines to keep in mind.

## Accuracy In Battle

Remember the basic move from earlier:

> When you do something risky or dangerous, roll 2d6 and add a relevant attribute score.
> 
> - On a 12+, you do it perfectly, with some additional benefit.
> - On a 10-11, you do it perfectly.
> - On a 7-9, you do it, but with some cost or complication.
> - On a 6-, you fail to do it, with some additional negative consequence.

In battle, a 6 or less doesn't mean that the attack has to miss completely. Is the attacker close to another enemy? Why not have the attack connect there?

## Leveling Up

In The Source, players level up after gaining 1000 experience points. Experience points can be gained in battle. This means that a player could concieveably level up during a fight, pick an advancement that could turn the battle around completely and then perform some glorious move to save the party.

The level cap is normally 12. If players get more experience and want to level up past that, you will need to create more advancements.

## Adapting Enemies From Other Games

This is a bit of a tricky situation. Monsters from other games are typically balanced for that game and its battle logic. The Source (and by extension 6E) follows different rules. At a high level, monsters should follow at least the following archetype.

Every enemy has a challenge statistic, which is the approximate "difficulty" of an enemy. The challenge of an enemy should help you figure out how many experience points it should award on defeat. A simple way to calculate this is to multiply the challenge level by 50.

___
> ## Sand Lizard
> *Lizards from the sand of Miau*
> ___
> - **Hit Points** 12
>___
> - **Condition Immunities** stuns
> - **Challenge** 2 (100 xp)
> ___
>
> ***Lizard Speed*** This creature can quickly charge in for attacks. 
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Super Spin*** *Melee Attack:* d6

More monsters will be added in future supplements like Miau. Dungeon World can function as a good source of monster data.

## Initiative

Rolling for initiative is done by having every player roll a d10 and then ordering by the the results. If two players tie, have them roll a second d10 and that establishes their order within the tie order.

For example, if Divae rolls a 10, Gassas rolls a 3, Aruna also rolls a 3 and Vesryn rolls a 1, Gassas and Aruna would then roll another d10 to figure out if Aruna or Gassas performs actions first.

## Bosses

Boss encounters should offer a challenge to players. Make them think out of the box. Don't have bosses just be a "whack this guy with your sword until they run out of HP" fest. Experiment. Make the boss activate traps or something. Dungeons and Dragons supplements can help you come up with ideas for this. Tales from the Yawning Portal or other beginner campaign material can also help.

## You Don't Always Have To Fight

Sometimes diplomacy can be used instead of straight up battle tactics. Maybe you can convince the enemies you are not a threat. High charisma rolls can function as Jedi mind tricks in a pinch. Be creative! Also, avoid torturing people if you can help it.
