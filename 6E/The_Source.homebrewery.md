# The Source

Welcome, traveler, to The Source. The worlds here are perilous and full of danger, but also full of promise and adventure! In The Source, we prioritize a few ground rules in order to ensure that everyone has as much fun as possible as well as the best adventure they can.

This document will also contain erratta that have come up during 6E games so things can be somewhat consistent in the future.

## Ground Rules

These are the basic ground rules that should be followed at all times.

### Be Creative

Just because it looks like something doesn't mean you have to treat it like it is that thing. Don't be afraid to bend the rules or go off the beaten path. The real fun happens there. You may have to make the Dungeon Master improvise a situation, this is never a bad thing.

### Make Sure Everyone is Involved

Resist the temptation to railroad the adventure in a non-inclusive way for too long. It can feel like fun to do it, but your party-mates are your friends and should be involved as much as possible. That's how the stories of heroes become legends of groups.

### Make Sure Everyone is Comfortable

Don't be afraid to let the Dungeon Master know if something is overwhelming or the like. They will be happy to help refocus people away from uncomfortable topics to ensure everyone has the most fun they can. Let the Dungeon Master know in a private message or with the Roll20 macro #uncomfortable.

### Be Respectful

Everyone comes from a different background and has had different life experiences. These experiences shape their lives and can sometimes manifest in the course of play. Respect this, this diversity of experience helps shape people's adventures and can lead to glory.

### Maximize Fun

We're ultimately here to play a game together. Take advantage of this and help to maximize the amount of fun everyone has. This will help games to be more memorable and lead to a stronger friendship.

The rules are very light on purpose, but even then they are paper thin when it comes to maximizing enjoyment. The Dungeon Master will usually be the judge of when to break the rules unless you can convince them otherwise.

### Don't Be An Asshole

Nobody likes it when someone is an asshole.

<div class='footnote'>BASIC RULES</div>

# Basic Rules

At a high level, all of the action in 6E games boils down to two things: The Basic Move and storytelling. Everything else builds on top of these two fundamentals to create the story of your players and their actions.

## The Basic Move

When you do something risky or dangerous, roll 2d6 and add a relevant attribute score.

- On a 12+, you do it perfectly, with some additional benefit.
- On a 10-11, you do it perfectly.
- On a 7-9, you do it, but with some cost or complication.
- On a 6-, you fail to do it, with some additional negative consequence.

Every player has the following attributes:

| Stat Name | Acronym | Example |
|:----------|:--------|:--------|
| Strength | STR | Damage, breaking things |
| Dexteriry | DEX | Aim, finesse, acrobatics |
| Constitution | CON | Endurance |
| Intelligence | INT | Reasoning, knowledge about the area |
| Wisdom | WIS | Percieving traps, calming monsters |
| Charisma | CHA | Social skills, bluffing, haggling |

Every class will also have their own special moves. These will build on top of the basic move (EG: Clerics/Wizards casting spells, Artificers creating things) and may cause disadvantageous side effects if they fail.

Moves only make sense when there is a sense of _risk_ involved to things. Breaking a door down isn't risky unless there are monsters behind it. Picking a lock isn't risky if nobody can hear it or catch you doing it. Haggling isn't risky unless you are starved for gold. Attacks aren't risky if they aren't fantastic.

## Dungeon Master Advice

This is a fantasy roleplaying game. Your job is to help the players explore the world, have adventures and craft legends as a group. Read through this supplement and maybe a Dungeons and Dragons starter guide or two. Take things as they happen and don't be afraid to ask your players for ideas. Improvisation only can go so far.

Also, failure doesn't have to be a complete failure. If you fail a hit on a monster, you could just transfer that damage to another nearby monster instead of nullifying it out. Doing this helps keep the players in the flow of the game and make everything fun for everyone.

Remember the rules (even though there are only a few of them) are NOT written in stone; and if something comes up that you feel is "wrong", make up something else! Don't be afraid to ask your players for amusing ideas. They are a very valuable resource for this!

As the Dungeon Master, you  should let the players know what the risks are before they roll. This lets players be informed and they might change their minds about their actions. This is good, this means your players are thinking!

To quote the 6E handbook:

> **When you fight an enemy in melee**, roll+STR. A 7-9 might mean that you successfully do your damage to the enemy, but they do their damage to you, or disarm you. A 6- might mean that you don’t do your damage to the enemy, and they do their damage
> 
> **When shooting an enemy at range**, roll+DEX. A 7-9 might mean that you successfully do your damage to the enemy, but they manage to move into melee range of you and swing - What do you do? A 6- might mean that you miss, and that was your last arrow!
> 
> **When you look for rumors in town**, buy a round for the local publicans and roll+CHA. A 10+ might mean you get two rumors. A 7-9 might mean you only get 1 rumor. A 6- might mean you put your trust in bad information.

## Using Withinbot

[Withinbot](https://github.com/Xe/withinbot) is a Discord bot written in Rust that helps to manage dice and stat rolling for 6E games. It is present by default in the guild for The Source, but if you want to add it to your own guild you can click [this link][withinbotinvite].

##### Dice

Dice rolling is done with the ~roll command. It takes arguments that look like this:
___
~roll [number of dice]d[number of dice sides][+/-modifier]  
~roll 3d6  
[2, 5, 2] = 9

The bot will reply with the list of dice that fed into the roll and the result.

##### Stats

Stats can be rolled with the ~roll_stats command. It takes no arguments and creates a stat sheet for a new 6E character.

___
~roll_stats  
Your stats are: STR: 1, DEX: -2, CON: -1, INT: 0, WIS: 1, CHA: 2: HP: 5

---
Rolling for stats will be explained in detail below.

<div class='footnote'>BASIC RULES</div>

## Character Creation

Character creation is done in a few phases:

1. Help everyone choose a class and have them choose a class advancement for level one
2. Tell them how to roll their attributes
3. Tell them how to roll their hitpoints
4. Help them figure out how many inventory slots they have and explain how weight works
5. Get some equipment

### Choosing A Class

Show the players the list of classes in the book. If they want to run something else, give them the blank sheet and help them work through creating their own class. Make sure everyone has the base character sheet for their character. If running a game with people who haven't played tabletop games before, stick to the 4 core classes of Cleric, Fighter, Thief and Wizard.

Have them fill out their name and pick an advancement on the second page of their character sheet. Encourage them to pick an advanacement that sounds amusing to them, or something that could become useful. Players will get another advancement every level they gain.

### Rolling for Attributes

Attributes in 6E are a bit different than they are in other tabletop games. For each attribute roll two six-sided dice. Then use the following table to determine your attribute:

| Roll | Attribute |
|:-----|:----------|
| 11+ | 2 |
| 9-10 | 1 |
| 6-8 | 0 |
| 4-5 | -1 |
| 3- | -2 |

Put these atttributes in the circles labled Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitituion (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS) and Charisma (CHA). These function as bonuses to rolls for the basic move.

### Rolling for Hitpoints

Add up your level (in most cases this will be one) with your constitution stat. If this number ends up being below one, it's one. Roll that many six-sided dice and pick as many as your character has levels. This becomes your hitpoint (HP) stat. Consider this example:

Faeor is at level 1 with a constitution stat of 2. Faeor rolls three six-sided dice and gets a 5, 4 and a 6. Faeor then chooses which dice to keep as their HP stat, picking the 6.

Players may re-roll their HP if they are stuck with only one hitpoint. If a player consistently gets one for their HP roll, the Dungeon Master should give them a HP stat that they feel makes sense for the player.

### Inventory Slots

By default, every player gets 12 inventory slots. This number is then modified by their strength statistic. If the player's strength is +2, then they get two more inventory slots for a total of 14. If their strength is -2, then they lose two inventory slots for a total of 10. Cross off the numbers for any unusable inventory slots.

If a player ever carries more stuff then they have inventory slots, they get 2 subtracted from all of their rolls.

### Getting Equipment

Everyone starts out with one or two remarkable items, or items that give players a small advantage in extremely specific circumstances. There are some examples below. Don't worry about basic adventuring gear like weapons, armor and torches. They can be gotten with gear points.

- Dueling Sword - +1 when you’re defending your honor with threats of (or actual) violence.
- Quick Pick - +1 when you need to open a lock quick or quiet, so no one notices.
- Lucky Helmet - +1 when you need to avoid a freak accident.
- Trusty Waterskin - You (only) may drink from it when you rest to roll one additional die for your HP — keep the normal amount though.
- Component Pouch - If you would forget a spell, you may spend the contents to prevent forgetting it. One use, refills when you refresh your Gear bubbles.
- Fancy Hat - +1 when you’re making a deal with a merchant or statesman.
- Mercurial Wand - Once/day you can use this to cast a random spell from the Wizard Spell List — better roll for it!
- Loaded Dice - +1 when you gamble with them.

### Gear Points

Gear points can be spent to acquire "basic" adventuring gear like torches, light weapons, staffs, bows, shields, armor and miscellaneous things. When you need a standard piece of mundane adventuring gear that’s not currently in your inventory, you may fill in an empty bubble to declare that you had the item all along. If you do so, write the item in your inventory.

When you’re in town, you may spend 25g to empty all of your gear points. You get to keep the items if you want.

### Making Things Up

If players want to have more spells or things they can do, help them work out something new. You can use descriptions from other fantasy games like Dungeons and Dragons or Dungeon World. Just read the names and descriptions, the stats aren't as important (the exact stats in those games are likely to be balanced for that game and that may disrupt the balance in 6E).

Don't be afraid to make things up though, that's how things become fun!

<div class='footnote'>RACES</div>

# Races

The world of The Source is home to an unimaginable number of races. Each of these can have members be good, evil or somewhere inbetween. Each race has their own set of bonuses that may or may not be useful. They each all may have their own ancestral languages, but every player character race can at least speak one language in common with all of the others.

# The Artificier

The Artificier is a class defined by their ability to fashion usable things out of other things. These things are highly breakable (depending on the materials) and there is a limit to how many times the forge engine can be used in a limited amount of time. These extra caveats were made in order to make the Artificier more balanced.

## Forge Engine

The Artificier carries a handheld forge engine with them (it does not take up an inventory slot) that can be used to make various Genius Creations. This forge engine takes gold + materials and creates something using it. The materials fed into the forge engine influence the effect of the creations. The following table will help the Dungeon Master balance the creations:

| Material      | Strength |
|:--------------|:---------|
| Foraged Wood  | 2        |
| Wood          | 3        |
| Foraged Metal | 4        |
| Metal         | 5        |

The Strength of a given material influences how many failed (or partially failed) rolls the creation can survive before it will break (this should be taken as a soft guideline for the Dungeon Master, not a hard one). Genius creations will also only be active for twice as many turns as the strength shows. The more gold something costs, the more materials it will require (the Dungeon Master can help decide if there are enough materials to craft something).

The Artificier can also pre-create genius creations in a tavern or other safe space and store them in their inventory, provided they have room and materials for them.


## Genius Creations

This list is not complete and will be added to as facts and circumstances emerge.

___
1. **Alchemical Elixir**, 10 gp, 1 weight. With an empty flask in your possession, you create one of the following elixirs:
   - Healing. Heal 2d4+INT HP 
   - Resilient. Gain +1 Armor 
   - Brave. +1d4 to attack rolls for a short time 
   - Flight. Drinker gains flight for a short time 
1. **Arcane Ballista Cannon**, 25 gp, 3 weight. You create a small magical bipedal cannon. It shares your initiative count, but acts after you do. It has +2 Armor and HP equal to four times your level. It attacks for 1d6 damage. This uses a creation bubble when deployed.
1. **Arcane Protector Cannon**, 4 weight, 30 gp. You create a small magical bipedal cannon that emits a burst of positive energy which heals 1d6 nearby allies for 1d6+INT. It shares your initiative count, but acts after you do. It has +1 Armor and HP equal to four times your level. This uses a creation bubble when deployed.
1. **Enhance Weapon**, 15 gp. Imbue a weapon of your choice with magical energy, providing +1 to attack and damage rolls. 
1. **Enhance Defense**, 15 gp. Imbue a shield or armor of your choice with magical energy, providing a +1 armor bonus. 
1. **Enhance Focus**, 20 gp. Boost an ally’s aura granting +1 to spells.
