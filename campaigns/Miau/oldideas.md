# Miau Campaign Ideas

A campaign for The Source by Mai.

Goal: return an amulet that controls the sandstorms that have been buffering the
city of Cihan so that trade can be restored and stuff.

Takes place in the desert of Miau, where the cat people have lived in harmony
with the land. Think Gerudo from Breath of the Wild.

## Suggested Characters

* Fighter
* Cleric
* Wizard
* Thief/Wildcard

Cat people have communication bonus of +1 in Cihan due to the citizens trusting
their own kind more. This applies to the shapeshifter's current form too.

## Words

* Ci /tʃi/ - safe, water (archaic)
* Cihan /tʃi.hʌn/ - new-safe
* Lum /lum/ - sand, desert
* Ag /ʌɡ/ - water
* Sivu /si.vu/ - hello
* Miau /miʌu/ - home
* Mihari /mi.hʌ.ri/ - name of a goddess of the desert, usually clad in decorative gold armor
